- Render an initial list of items to the page
- Implement controls to remove existing items
- Implement a means to set one of the items as ‘selected’
- Implement controls to add new items based on text input

Not obligatory, but nice to add:
- State management
- Tests
- Styling
- Type safety (either Flow or Typescript)
- Tests (just one or two to show your ability of using them)
